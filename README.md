**Title: Real-Time Face Mask Detection Project**

**Objective:**

  Developed a real-time face mask detection system to enhance public safety by identifying individuals wearing or not wearing face masks.
Tools and Technologies:

**Programming Language:** Python

**Libraries:** OpenCV, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy

**Framework:** TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning model training




**Key Features:**

**Real-Time Detection:** Utilized OpenCV for live video feed processing to detect face masks in real-time.

**Pre-trained Models:** Leveraged pre-trained models such as MobileNetV2 for efficient face mask classification. 

**Custom Dataset:** Created and labeled a custom dataset of masked and unmasked faces to improve model accuracy.

**Data Augmentation:** Applied techniques like rotation, zoom, and flip to augment the dataset and enhance model robustness.

**Face Detection:** Implemented a face detection algorithm using Haar Cascades or Dlib for identifying facial regions in images and video frames.

**Mask Classification:** Trained a deep learning model to classify detected faces as masked or unmasked with high accuracy.

**Alert System:** Developed an alert system to notify users when a person without a mask is detected.

**Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Ensured the solution works across various operating systems including Windows, macOS, and Linux.



**Implementation Details:**

**Real-Time Inference:**
